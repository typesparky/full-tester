- `forecast_horizon` - What period this covers ("September 2025 monthly" or "2025 annual")
- `monthly_inflation_estimate` - Expected monthly CPI change (as decimal: 0.0017 = 0.17%)
- `annual_inflation_estimate` - Expected annual CPI level (as decimal: 0.054 = 5.4%)
- `confidence_level` - Quality rating (high/medium/low)
- `source_markets_count` - Number of Polymarket contracts used
- `methodology` - "VWEV_Rolled" - Volume-Weighted Expected Value with futures rolling

## ðŸ”§ METHODOLOGY
- **VWEV_Rolled**: Volume-Weighted Expected Value with backward ratio adjustment
- **Distribution Reconstruction**: Builds full probability distributions from threshold markets
- **Pareto Tail Fitting**: Handles open-ended inflation ranges (>10%)
- **Futures Rolling**: Stitches together discrete event forecasts into continuous signals

## ðŸ“ˆ USAGE
Import directly into Excel, Python pandas, or any analysis tool:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('final_inflation_forecasts.csv')
# Analyze monthly vs annual forecasts
monthly = df[df['forecast_horizon'].str.contains('monthly')]
annual = df[df['forecast_horizon'].str.contains('annual')]
```

Directly usable for quantitative models, backtesting, and market analysis.
